### Abstract
Plug-and-play priors (PnP) is a popular framework forregularized signal reconstruction by using advanced denoisers within aniterative algorithm. In this paper, we discuss our recent online variantof PnP [1] that uses only a subset of measurements at every iteration,which makes it scalable to very large datasets. We additionally presentnovel convergence results for both batch and online PnP algorithms.
