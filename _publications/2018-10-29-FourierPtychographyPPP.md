excerpt: 'The plug-and-play priors (PnP) framework has been recently shown to achieve state-of-the-art results in regularized image reconstruc- tion by leveraging a sophisticated denoiser within an iterative algo- rithm. In this paper, we propose a new online PnP algorithm for Fourier ptychographic microscopy (FPM) based on the fast iterative shrinkage/threshold algorithm (FISTA). Specifically, the proposed algorithm uses only a subset of measurements, which makes it scal- able to a large set of measurements. We validate the algorithm by showing that it can lead to significant performance gains on both simulated and experimental data.'

### Abstract
The plug-and-play priors (PnP) framework has been recently shown to achieve state-of-the-art results in regularized image reconstruc- tion by leveraging a sophisticated denoiser within an iterative algo- rithm. In this paper, we propose a new online PnP algorithm for Fourier ptychographic microscopy (FPM) based on the fast iterative shrinkage/threshold algorithm (FISTA). Specifically, the proposed algorithm uses only a subset of measurements, which makes it scal- able to a large set of measurements. We validate the algorithm by showing that it can lead to significant performance gains on both simulated and experimental data.
