excerpt: 'We consider the problem of estimating a vector from its noisy measurements using a prior specified only through a denoising function. Recent work on plug-and-play priors (PnP) and regularization-by-denoising (RED) has shown the state-of-the-art performance of estimators under such priors in a range of imaging tasks. In this work, we develop a new block coordinate RED algorithm that decomposes a large-scale estimation problem into a sequence of updates over a small subset of the unknown variables. We theoretically analyze the convergence of the algorithm and discuss its relationship to the traditional proximal optimization. Our analysis complements and extends recent theoretical results for RED-based estimation methods. We numerically validate our method using several denoiser priors, including those based on convolutional neural network (CNN) denoisers.'

### Abstract
Recent work has shown the effectiveness of the plug-and-play priors (PnP) framework for regularized image reconstruction. However, the performance of PnP depends on the quality of the denoisers used as priors. In this letter, we design a novel PnP denoising prior, called multiple self-similarity net (MSSN), based on the recurrent neural network (RNN) with self-similarity matching using multi-head attention mechanism. Unlike traditional neural net denoisers, MSSN exploits different types of relationships among non-local and repeating features to remove the noise in the input image. We numerically evaluate the performance of MSSN as a module within PnP for solving magnetic resonance (MR) image reconstruction. Experimental results show the stable convergence and excellent performance of MSSN for reconstructing images from highly compressive Fourier measurements.
