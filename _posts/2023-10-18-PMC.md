&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **New Paper on arXiv:** My work on provabl probabilistic imaging is now on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10835)! In this work, I proposed plug-and-play Monte Carlo (PMC) as a principled framework to perform posterior sampling for general imaging inverse problems. PMC is able to leverage the score-based generative priors from the recent diffusion models.
