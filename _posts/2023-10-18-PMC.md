&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; **New Paper on arXiv:** My work *["Provable Probabilistic Imaging using Score-Based Generative Priors"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10835)* is now on arXiv! In this work, I proposed plug-and-play Monte Carlo (PMC) as a principled framework to perform posterior sampling for general imaging inverse problems.
