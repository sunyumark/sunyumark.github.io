### Hi! Welcome to Yu Sun's website!
I am Yu Sun and a second-year Ph.D student in the Computational Imaging Group (CIG) with the Department of CSE at Washington University in St. Louis (Wash U). CIG is a super cool place, and we develop cutting-edge technologies in computational imaging. 

Before I joined the lab, I received B.Eng. and M.S. from Sichuan Univiesity and Washingtion University in St. Louis in 2015 and 2017, respectively. I love my college (SCU), where I had an extremely colorful lifte there. Also, the city Chengdu (where my college is) is ‘a city you will never want to leave once you come.’

Currently, my research of interests include imaging with deep learning (eg. diffraction tomography, Fourier Ptychography), denoising-driven algorithms, and large-scale distributed algorithms. Feel free to follow me if you think my research is interesting! Here you can find my [CV](/files/cv.pdf)

Reading books is my biggest hobby. You can find my *reading list* (Chinese version, English verison soon) [here](/files/reading_list.pdf).
