### Hi! Welcome to my website!
I am Yu Sun and a first-year Ph.D student in the Computational Imaging Group (CIG) with the Department of CSE at Washington University in St. Louis. CIG is a super cool place, and we develop cutting-edge technologies in computational imaging. Before I join the lab, I received B.Eng. and M.S. from Sichuan Univiesity and Washingtion University in St. Louis in 2015 and 2017, respectively. My research of interests include imaging with deep learning (eg. diffraction tomography, Fourier Ptychography), optimizations algorithms, and optimization theory. Feel free to follow us if you think our research is interesting!

Reading books is my biggest hobby. You can find my *reading list* (chinese version) [here](/files/reading_list.pdf).
