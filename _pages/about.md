Hi! Welcome to my website!
I am Yu Sun and a current Ph.D student in the Computational Imaging Group (CIG) with the Department of CSE at Washington University in St. Louis. CIG is a super cool place and we develop cutting-edge technologies in computational imaging. Before I join the lab, I received B.Eng. and M.S. from Sichuan Univiesity and Washingtion University in St. Louis in 2015 and 2017, respectively. My research of interest corresponds to applying deep learning to image reconstruction problems (eg. diffractiion tomography), developping algorithms for large-scale optimization, and investigating related theories such as fix point theory.
